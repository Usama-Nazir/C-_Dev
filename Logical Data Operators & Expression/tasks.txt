1.5.12   LAB   Logical data: operators and expressions
Level of difficulty
Easy

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

comparing values using relational operators;
building complex Boolean expressions using logical operators;
translating verbal description into programming language.
Scenario
Take a look at the code in the editor: it reads an integer value, and is then ready to perform a complicated magical test and print the answer – it may be positive or it may not. Okay, you may be a bit surprised with the form of the line sending the result to the output, but don't worry – it'll look familiar to you soon. Just accept it as-is and just remember that the purpose of this construction is to write a clear message concerning the test result.

Now listen to an ancient story that says:

We need a number whose value:

is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 10, or
multiplied by 2 is less than 20 and reduced by 2 is greater than minus 2, or
reduced by 1 is greater than 1 and divided by 2 is less than 10, or
is equal to 111.
Write the above condition in the form of an expression accepted by the C++ language and assign its result to the answer variable.

Test your code using the data we've provided.
