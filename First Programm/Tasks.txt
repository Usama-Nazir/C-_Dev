Try to:

add a greeting – let the program welcome you in a warm and pleasant way;
duplicate (or triplicate) the greeting to welcome more than one person;
insert a line saying cout << endl; between two other couts and check the effects it has; does it look interesting? You're going to learn more about it soon;
now try to insert a mysteriously-looking sequence of chars into any of the greeting: \n – there are exactly two characters: a backslash and lower-case n; what happens now?;
try to remove any of the semicolons and look carefully at the compiler's response; pay attention to where the compiler sees an error – is this where the error really is?
change the name of the main function to any other lexically correct word (e.g. Main); what happens now? Can you explain the result?
remove some of the quotes (opening and closing ones respectively); does the compiler like that? What does it think of your actions?
